# jobify Makefile — convenience targets for local + CI workflows.

# `make test` runs the pytest suite (the default ``-m 'not legacy'``
# filter in pyproject.toml excludes the retired Path-B forensic
# scaffold tests under tests/legacy/). The pre-consolidation
# import-wiring smoke harness was the principal user of the
# Browserbase + Stagehand path; with that path retired, the harness
# is parked at ``scripts/smoke_legacy.py`` and is exposed here as
# ``make legacy-smoke`` for forensics only — it is NOT a CI target.
