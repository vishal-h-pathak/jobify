storage.py — Supabase Storage helpers for the submitter.

Uploads review screenshots back into the job-materials bucket. The download
helpers (``download_to_tmp`` and ``download_bytes``) moved to
``jobify.shared.storage`` in PR-1; they are re-exported below for backward
compatibility with this module's existing callers.

# Module reference, not ``from jobify.db import service_client``: the

# constructing a Supabase client (and raising in secretless CI). Going
# through the module defers that to first call.

# PR-1 moved download_to_tmp / download_bytes into jobify.shared.storage to
# unify the previously-divergent applicant + submitter implementations. Re-
# export them here so ``import storage`` from runner.py (and any other
# unprefixed-import callsite inside the submit subtree) keeps working — the
# stated intent of this shim per the module docstring.
