"""handoff.py — always-assisted-manual fallback for the prepare flow.

The prepare flow's worst-case output is *not* a bare failure. Whenever it
can't finish a clean pre-fill — the agent called ``queue_for_review``, an
adapter raised, required fields were left empty, the ATS couldn't be resolved,
the page failed to load — it degrades to an "assisted-manual hand-off":

  1. the browser tab is left OPEN on the application page (this module never
     closes the page — closing on success→next is the orchestrator's job);
  2. the tailored resume + cover letter are downloaded to a predictable local
     folder the user can drag from;
  3. a checklist of what couldn't be filled is printed AND written to the jobs
     row so the cockpit can show it;
  4. the row is marked ``awaiting_human_submit`` (the same lane a clean
     pre-fill lands in — "human, take over in the open tab") with a structured
     ``ASSISTED-MANUAL`` reason that distinguishes it from a clean pre-fill.

Status note: the original spec said ``needs_review``, which is a *retired*
``jobs.status`` value (``LEGACY_STATUS_MAP`` → ``ready_for_review``) and would
raise in :func:`jobify.db.update_job_status`. We land the row on the canonical
``awaiting_human_submit`` instead; the ``ASSISTED-MANUAL`` marker + checklist in
``application_notes`` carry the "this was a degraded hand-off" signal.
