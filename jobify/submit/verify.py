"""verify.py — post-fill verification summary (Part B / #4).

After an adapter finishes pre-filling a form (cleanly OR degrading to an
assisted-manual hand-off), turn its result into a one-line, human-readable
summary the cockpit renders next to the "Submitted ✓ → Next" button:

    filled 4 of 5 required field(s); still needs: Phone

For the deterministic adapters (greenhouse / lever / ashby) the required set
and the still-empty set come straight from the declarative field map plus the
adapter's ``required_empty`` (Part A). For the universal agent path there is
no field map — the summary degrades to whatever the agent flagged
(``uncertain_fields``) and reports no fixed denominator.

This module is pure (no DB / browser) so it is trivially unit-tested; the
pipeline does the screenshot + row write around it.
