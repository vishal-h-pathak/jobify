review/packet.py — Build a review packet for jobs that land in needs_review.

║  LEGACY (Path B). Built for the Browserbase + Stagehand auto-submit  ║
║  flow that was retired during the local-Playwright consolidation.    ║
║  Under Path A, the cockpit's "Pre-fill Form" + visible-browser flow  ║
║  surfaces the same evidence directly via                             ║
║  ``application_attempts.notes`` and ``jobs.prefill_screenshot_path`` ║
║  — no packet build step. Kept only as reference. Do not extend.      ║
╚══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╝


A packet is the evidence a human needs to triage a failed-to-auto-submit job
in under a minute from the portfolio dashboard at /review/[job_id]. It
bundles: the pre-submit screenshot, the list of filled fields + their values,
the list of skipped/uncertain fields with reasons, and a deep link to the
Browserbase session replay.

The packet is stored as JSON in jobs.submission_log; any screenshots live in
Supabase Storage under job-materials/{job_id}/review/.

Stub: Milestone 5 fills in screenshot handling, storage uploads, and the
portfolio-facing shape. For now the function signatures document the
intended contract.
