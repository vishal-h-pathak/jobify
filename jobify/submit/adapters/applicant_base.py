"""applicant_base.py — Abstract base for sync Playwright DOM-based applicants (PR-7).

Co-located with the async deterministic ``Adapter`` in
``submit/adapters/base.py``. Both classes back form-fill adapters but they do
NOT share a Python superclass: their lifecycles diverge enough that any common
ancestor would be empty.

  - ``Adapter`` (base.py):       async, takes ``SubmissionContext``, returns
                                 ``SubmissionResult``. Used by the
                                 deterministic Stagehand+Browserbase submitters
                                 in ``deterministic/{ashby,lever,greenhouse}.py``.
  - ``BaseApplicant`` (this):    sync, takes ``(page, job, resume_path,
                                 cover_letter_path)``, returns a dict. Used by
                                 the prepare-only Playwright DOM fillers in
                                 ``prepare_dom/{ashby,lever,greenhouse,universal}.py``.

Behavior delta from the previous location (``tailor/applicant/base.py``):
none. Class definitions, method bodies, and screenshot path layout are
identical. Two cosmetic changes: Playwright is imported lazily inside
``start_browser()`` instead of at module top, and ``OUTPUT_DIR`` is imported
lazily inside ``take_screenshot()`` from ``jobify.tailor.paths`` (same
tempdir resolution rules as before — the tailor subtree remains the
canonical ``OUTPUT_DIR`` source until the submit subtree gains its own).
Both deferrals exist so ``tests/test_prepare_dom_common.py`` can exercise
sibling helpers without Playwright + tailor side-effects fired at import time.

Subclasses must implement:
    - ``detect(url) -> bool``: whether this applicant handles the given URL
    - ``fill_form(page, job, resume_path, cover_letter_path) -> dict``
