"""
adapters/base.py — Contracts every ATS adapter implements.

The single most important rule: adapters FILL but do not SUBMIT. They produce
a SubmissionResult describing their readiness and evidence. confirm.py reads
the result and decides whether to click submit or route to needs_review.

This separation is the architectural lesson from the previous system, which
conflated "can I fill this field" with "should I send this application" and
made failures hard to localize.
