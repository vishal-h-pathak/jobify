adapters/generic_stagehand.py — Fallback adapter driven by Stagehand's agent loop.

╔══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╗
║  LEGACY (Path B). The Stagehand-agent fallback was retired with the  ║
║  rest of the Browserbase path. Path A's universal fallback is        ║
║  ``submit/adapters/prepare_dom/universal.py`` (local Playwright +    ║
║  the prepare-only Claude tool-use agent), which is what              ║
║  ``jobify.shared.ats_detect.get_applicant`` returns when no         ║
║  per-ATS handler matches. Do not extend this module.                 ║
╚══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╝

The deterministic adapters (Greenhouse, Lever, Ashby) cover ~70% of postings
job-hunter surfaces. For the rest — Workday, iCIMS, SmartRecruiters, in-house
forms, anything the detector can't confidently place — we hand the form to
Stagehand's `execute` agent loop with a detailed instruction and let it drive.

Trade-offs vs a deterministic adapter:
  + Zero per-ATS maintenance; any form the agent can read, it can try.
  - Higher cost: sh_execute can burn 10-25 tool calls per submission (~$0.50-2).
  - Lower confidence ceiling: we cap recommend=needs_review regardless of agent
    optimism, because the agent has no mechanical guarantee every required
    field was populated correctly. Human-in-the-loop review on the Browserbase
    replay closes that gap.

Never clicks submit — confirm.click_submit_and_verify is the only allowed
path to hitting the submit button. The instruction forbids it explicitly
(rule 5), with redundancy because agents in open-ended form-filling like to
finish the job.

You are filling out an online job application form on behalf of an applicant.

Applicant profile — use these facts verbatim. Do NOT invent anything not listed.
  Name: {first_name} {last_name}
  Email: {email}
  Phone: {phone}
  Location: {location}
  LinkedIn: {linkedin}
  Website: {website}
  GitHub: {github}
  Current title: {current_title}
  Current company: {current_company}

Effectively-required answers (use when the form asks):
  Work authorization: {work_authorization}
  Need visa sponsorship: {visa_sponsorship_needed}
  Earliest start date: {earliest_start_date}
  Relocation willingness: {relocation_willingness}
  In-person / remote preference: {in_person_willingness}
  AI-usage policy acknowledgement (paste verbatim if asked): {ai_policy_ack}
  Prior interviews: {previous_interview_summary}

Role applying for: {title}

Rules:
  1. Fill every REQUIRED field (asterisked, aria-required, or clearly marked)
     with a value derivable from the applicant profile above.
  2. SKIP demographic / EEO / voluntary-disclosure questions (race, gender,
     veteran status, disability, sexual orientation, "how did you hear",
     name pronunciation, pronouns, hobbies). These are opt-in by policy.
  3. If a required field needs a fact not in the applicant profile above,
     STOP filling that field and note it as missing. Do not guess.
  4. The resume and cover-letter PDFs have already been uploaded via CDP.
     Do not attempt to re-upload them.
  5. DO NOT click the final submit / "Submit application" button. Stop after
     all fillable fields are filled. Clicking submit is handled by a separate
     verification step after this one. If the form spans multiple pages,
     "Next" / "Continue" is allowed, but any button labeled "Submit",
     "Send application", or equivalent is OFF LIMITS.
  6. If you encounter an unexpected error (CAPTCHA, dialog, login wall),
     stop and return what you've done so far — do not attempt to solve it.
