"""prepare_dom/greenhouse.py — Greenhouse ATS DOM-based form filler (M-3).

Greenhouse hosts forms at boards.greenhouse.io / job-boards.greenhouse.io
/ apply.greenhouse.io. The forms are server-rendered HTML with stable
``name`` attributes like ``job_application[first_name]``, so we prefer those
over label-based heuristics. Uses ``job["form_answers"]`` (M-1) as the
authoritative source of identity / contact / location values — zero
Anthropic API calls.

Greenhouse loads the form directly on the canonical job URL — no
overview-to-form navigation needed, unlike Ashby and Lever (PR-22). The
sibling ``prepare_dom/ashby.py`` appends ``/application`` and
``prepare_dom/lever.py`` appends ``/apply`` before surveying because their
URL spaces split overview vs. form. Greenhouse does not, so this adapter
operates directly on whatever URL the orchestrator hands it. If a future
Greenhouse template introduces a separate overview page, mirror the PR-22
URL-prepend pattern from those siblings.

Same shape as ``prepare_dom/ashby.py``: static ``detect()``, ``fill_form()``
returning ``{success, screenshot_path, notes, fields_filled}``. Does NOT
click Submit. After M-5 the orchestrator screenshots, marks the row
``awaiting_human_submit``, and blocks on terminal ``input()`` while the
human reviews the visible browser.

Known M-3 limitation: role-specific custom questions (rendered as
``job_application[answers_attributes][N][text_value]``) are NOT auto-filled
here — their wording varies enough that the safer path is to let the human
paste the draft answers from ``form_answers.additional_questions`` via the
cockpit copy buttons. The PR-7 helper
``_common.note_unfilled_custom_questions`` surfaces the operator-facing
note.

PR-7 history: shared sync Playwright helpers moved to
``prepare_dom/_common.py``. Part A (#3) then moved the Greenhouse field
*definitions* — the canonical input ``name`` per label, the phone selector
chain, the resume/cover-letter selector lists — out of this file and into
``field_maps.yml`` under the ``greenhouse`` key. This adapter is now thin:
load the spec list, build the value map, call ``apply_field_map``. The
``BaseApplicant`` import is the explicit
``jobify.submit.adapters.applicant_base`` path.
