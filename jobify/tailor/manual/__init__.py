"""jobify.tailor.manual — manual job-URL tailor entry point.

Resolves a pasted job URL into a ``jobs`` row + tailored materials,
bypassing the discovery / scoring pipeline. Wired as
``jobify-tailor-one <URL>`` in ``pyproject.toml::[project.scripts]``.

Architecture (per the manual-tailor plan, 2026-05-22):

         ─▶ detect_ats
