# Generate Cover Letter

You are writing a cover letter for Vishal Pathak. This is the most
important instruction: the letter must sound like Vishal wrote it himself
— not like an AI, not like a career coach, not like a template. Read the
voice profile carefully and match his tone exactly.

The CANDIDATE PROFILE (thesis.md canonical-first) and VOICE PROFILE are
in the system prompt. Read the voice profile carefully and match his
tone exactly.

JOB POSTING:
Title: {job_title}
Company: {company}
Description: {job_desc}
Job Tier: {tier} (1=neuro/dream job, 1.5=agentic/applied-AI builder, 2=sales eng, 3=ML/CV)
{context}
{match_chat_block}

CHOSEN ARCHETYPE (J-4 — frame the cover letter through this lane. The
opening + middle paragraphs should lead with the emphasis points below
rather than other parts of his history):
{archetype_block}

{degree_gate_block}

WRITING RULES — follow these strictly:

1. TONE: Write like Vishal explaining to a smart friend why this role makes sense for him.
   Conversational, technically precise, no corporate language. Use contractions. Use hedges
   where natural ("sort of", "pretty much", "honestly"). Be direct about motivations.

2. STRUCTURE:
   - Opening: What the company/role is doing and why it connects to his actual work history.
     One specific technical thread, not a generic hook. Never open with "I am writing to..."
     or "I was excited to see..." — start with the work itself.
   - Middle: 2-3 concrete things he built or did that are directly relevant. Include enough
     technical detail to be credible. Frame as narrative ("At GTRI, I spent two years..."),
     not bullet points or claims ("I have extensive experience in...").
   - Close: Why the timing makes sense and a low-key, direct call to action. Not "I would
     welcome the opportunity to discuss" — more like "Happy to talk through any of this."

3. THINGS THAT MUST NOT APPEAR (in addition to the global anti-slop list):
   - "I am confident that"
   - Any sentence that could appear in any other candidate's cover letter unchanged
   - Exclamation marks (zero of them)

4. LENGTH: 3-4 paragraphs, under 350 words. Every sentence earns its place.

5. HONESTY: Do NOT fabricate experiences or skills. If the role asks for something he
   doesn't have, don't address it. Focus on what's genuinely relevant.

6. TIER 1.5 FRAMING (agentic / applied-AI / forward-deployed engineering roles): lead
   with the autonomous job pipeline as a concrete, running system he designed and
   operates — what the stages are (multi-source discovery, LLM scoring on a dual
   fit/legitimacy axis, tailored materials generation, browser pre-fill that deliberately
   stops at submit for a human gate), the evidenced audit trail behind every attempt,
   the CI, the closed-loop pattern analysis of outcomes. Never call it "an AI project" —
   describe what it does. Then bring in the neuromorphic thread as the differentiator:
   he built neurons in silicon before he built agent systems.

7. ROLE-TYPE AWARENESS: For Tier 2 (sales/solutions engineering) applications:
   Vishal doesn't have formal SE experience, so DO NOT pretend he does. Instead, draw
   the honest parallel: at GTRI he regularly presented technical work to program sponsors,
   translated research outcomes for non-technical stakeholders, and built demos to secure
   continued funding. That IS solutions engineering in a different context. The cover letter
   should acknowledge the career pivot candidly — he's a deep technical engineer who wants
   to be closer to customers and products rather than behind a clearance wall.

Output the cover letter text only, no preamble or sign-off formatting.
