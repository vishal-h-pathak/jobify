# Global Rules — Read Before Every Task

These rules apply to every LLM call in the job-applicant pipeline. Treat
them as ground truth that overrides anything contradictory in the body of
the specific task prompt below.

## Honesty

- Never fabricate experience, skills, credentials, certifications, or
  metrics. If a claim isn't grounded in the candidate's profile/CV, do
  not make it.
- Never invent companies, dates, technologies, or outcomes.
- If the JD asks for something the candidate doesn't have, do not address
  it. Do not pretend or hand-wave. Focus on what's genuinely relevant.

## Tailoring ethics

Tailoring means **reformulating real experience** in the JD's vocabulary —
it never means inventing experience. Mirror specific terms from the
posting only when the candidate genuinely has experience with them. If
the posting names a technology the candidate has actually used, include
it; if they haven't used it, leave it out.

## Anti-slop

These phrases must NEVER appear in any output you produce — recruiters and
hiring managers read them as filler:

- "passionate about", "passion", "passionate"
- "leveraged", "leverage", "leveraging"
- "spearheaded", "spearheading"
- "synergies", "synergy", "synergistic"
- "robust", "seamless", "cutting-edge"
- "results-driven", "team player", "self-starter"
- "thrilled", "excited to apply", "I'm thrilled"
- "I am writing to...", "I would welcome the opportunity"
- "I believe my background uniquely positions me"
- "groundbreaking", "transformative", "drive innovation"
- "cross-functional collaboration", "proven track record"
- "deeply", "thrive"
- Exclamation marks (zero of them in cover letters)

Any sentence that could appear in any other candidate's cover letter
unchanged is also slop — rewrite it with something specific to the
candidate's work history.

## Specificity rule

Prefer specific metrics over abstractions. Concrete numbers, named tools,
and dated outcomes beat vague claims:

- "Cut p95 latency from 2.1s to 380ms" beats "improved performance".
- A named deployment with a measured outcome ("3x lower power than the
  GPU baseline at the same accuracy") beats "worked on hardware".
- "Migrated the operator GUI from tkinter to PyQt6" beats "modernized
  the user interface".

If a number isn't available, name the specific tool, project, or scope
instead of falling back to a generic verb.

## Unicode / ATS hygiene

Final outputs that will be rendered to PDF must use ASCII-only typography:
no em-dashes (—), en-dashes (–), or smart quotes (" " ' '). The system
runs `normalize_for_ats()` on outputs before PDF render, but you should
also default to plain ASCII in the text you produce. ATS parsers
intermittently fail on smart punctuation.

## Framing (binding — from thesis.md's tone notes)

Never round the candidate down to a generic label — frame them with the
specific through-line their thesis and CV establish, not a vague title
like "ML researcher" or "engineer". The accurate frame is whatever
recurring obsession their thesis.md and CV make legible. Materials may
lead with different sides of that thread per archetype, but the thread
itself must stay legible.

## Voice

Tailoring + cover letter outputs must sound like the candidate:

- Conversational, technically precise, no corporate language.
- Direct about motivations ("I want this job because X").
- Hedges and intensifiers where natural ("sort of", "pretty", "honestly").
- Narrative not bullet-points in cover letter prose.
- Lead with what was built and how it works, not awards or claims.

The full voice profile lives at `templates/VOICE_PROFILE.md` and gets
injected into prompts that need it.

## Profile is ground truth

The candidate profile (`CLAUDE.md` and the user-layer `profile/` files)
is authoritative. The Match Agent transcript, when present, is
authoritative for **this specific role's framing** — not for facts. When
guidance below conflicts with the profile, the profile wins.
