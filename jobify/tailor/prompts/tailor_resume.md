# Tailor Resume

You are tailoring a resume for Vishal Pathak. The resume must be strictly
professional — no personal statements, no interests section, no
"passionate about" language. Every bullet should describe something
concrete that was built, deployed, or shipped.

The CANDIDATE PROFILE (thesis.md canonical-first) and VOICE PROFILE are
in the system prompt. Use the voice profile for the tone of the summary
only.

JOB POSTING:
Title: {job_title}
Company: {company}
Description: {job_desc}
Job Tier: {tier} (1=neuro/dream job, 1.5=agentic/applied-AI builder, 2=sales eng, 3=ML/CV)
{match_chat_block}

CHOSEN ARCHETYPE (J-4 — bias your framing, emphasis areas, and bullet
rewrites toward this lane. The candidate is the same person; the
archetype is which side of his work to lead with):
{archetype_block}

RESUME RULES — follow these strictly:

1. SUMMARY: 2-3 sentences max. Written in Vishal's voice — technically precise, no fluff.
   Lead with what he does (engineer), the domain (neuro/ML/embedded), and years of experience.
   Do not include "passionate", "driven", or any soft descriptors.
   Example tone: "Electrical engineer with 7+ years across neuromorphic hardware, spiking neural
   networks, and embedded ML. Most recent work at GTRI deploying SNNs on Intel Loihi and
   real-time detection models on Jetson Orin."

2. EMPHASIS AREAS: Pick the 3-5 skills/experiences from his background that most directly
   match the job requirements. Only include things he actually has.

3. KEYWORDS: Mirror specific terms from the job posting that Vishal genuinely has experience
   with. If the posting says "computer vision" and he did RT-DETR, include it. If the posting
   says "Kubernetes" and he hasn't used it, do NOT include it.

4. EXPERIENCE ORDER: Reorder his roles so the most relevant work appears first. Always
   include both GTRI and Rain Neuromorphics. Personal projects (FlyGym, trading agent) can
   be included in a "Projects" section if they're relevant to the role.

5. BULLET STYLE: Each experience bullet should follow the pattern:
   [Action verb] + [specific thing built/done] + [tools/tech used] + [measurable outcome if available]
   Example: "Deployed spiking neural networks on Intel Kapoho Bay for low-power object detection,
   achieving 3x power reduction vs GPU baseline while preserving 94% mAP accuracy"

6. DO NOT fabricate experiences, skills, certifications, or metrics he doesn't have.

7. TIER 1.5 / AGENTIC BUILDER FRAMING (for LLM-agent, applied-AI, agent-infra, or
   forward-deployed engineering roles): The flagship proof artifact is the autonomous
   job-application pipeline he designed and operates — multi-source discovery, LLM scoring
   with a dual fit/legitimacy axis, tailored materials generation, browser pre-fill with a
   deliberate stop-at-submit human gate, a full audit trail (every attempt writes an
   evidenced row), CI, and closed-loop pattern analysis. Describe it concretely as a
   running system — stages, gates, data flow — NEVER as "an AI project". Personal projects
   ARE the relevant experience lane here: give the pipeline a Projects entry near the top.
   Secondary differentiator: his neuromorphic depth — among agent engineers he is the
   person who built neurons in silicon (Rain PCBs, VHDL SNNs, Loihi) before building
   agent systems.

8. TIER 2 FRAMING (for sales/solutions engineering roles): Vishal has no formal SE title,
   but he has relevant experience: presenting to DoD program sponsors, writing technical
   proposals, translating complex research into stakeholder-friendly deliverables, and
   building demos for non-technical decision-makers. Frame these GTRI experiences through
   an SE lens — they ARE pre-sales/post-sales activities, just in a government context.
   Also emphasize: Python proficiency, ability to build technical demos rapidly, comfort
   with customer-facing communication, and his autonomous AI agent projects (trading agent,
   job-hunter) which demonstrate full-stack product-minded engineering.
