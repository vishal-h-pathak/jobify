"""prompts/ — versioned markdown prompts for job-applicant.

Each `.md` file in this folder is a system or user prompt for a specific
LLM call site. `_shared.md` holds global rules (ethics, anti-slop,
specificity, voice) that are prepended once to every prompt loaded via
`load_prompt`.

Prompts are templated with Python's `str.format` — placeholders look like
`{name}` and JSON braces in the body must be doubled (`{{ }}`).

Multiple prompts can be composed in one call:
    load_prompt("agent_common", "agent_prepare", job_title=..., company=...)
joins them in order with `---` separators, with `_shared.md` prepended once.

  four years deploying SNNs on Intel Loihi-class hardware and writing
