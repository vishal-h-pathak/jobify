"""
pipeline.py — Tailor + Submit Agent entry points (renamed from main.py
in PR-4; split into two console scripts in PR-13).

Polls Supabase for approved / prefill-requested jobs and runs the
matching phase. PR-13 split the previous combined cycle into two
narrower entry points so an automated trigger (CI, cron) can run
tailoring — pure LLM + LaTeX + Storage, headless-friendly — without
dragging in the visible-browser pre-fill phase that needs a human at
the keyboard.

Wiring (pyproject.toml::[project.scripts]):
    jobify-tailor = jobify.tailor.pipeline:run_tailor_only
    jobify-submit = jobify.tailor.pipeline:run_submit_only

The combined ``run()`` / ``run_cycle()`` pair is kept for backward
compatibility with tools that invoke them directly (e.g. the legacy
smoke harness); ``run_cycle()`` emits a deprecation log line on every
invocation pointing callers at the split entry points.

Usage:
    jobify-tailor                          # Tailor one cycle (approved jobs)
    jobify-tailor --status                 # Print job counts by status
    jobify-tailor --test-tailor <job_id>   # Test material generation for a job (no status changes)
    jobify-submit                          # Pre-fill one cycle (prefill_requested jobs)
    jobify-submit --status                 # Same status output as the tailor

NOTE: ``jobify-submit`` here is the local-Playwright pre-fill phase.
The retired Browserbase + Stagehand runner lives at
``jobify/submit/runner_legacy.py`` and has no console-script binding.

# ── sys.path bootstrap ────────────────────────────────────────────────────
# The tailor subtree's intra-subtree modules use unprefixed imports
# (``from storage import ...``, ``from tailor.X import ...``,
# ``from prompts import ...``). When this module is imported
# as ``jobify.tailor.pipeline`` (e.g. via the ``jobify-tailor`` console
# script), sys.path won't contain ``jobify/tailor/`` and those bare
# imports would fail. Insert the directory before any other imports run
# so every downstream module load resolves cleanly. PR-9 rewrote the
# cross-cutting bare imports (``import db``, ``import config``,
# ``from notify import ...``) to canonical ``jobify.*`` paths and
# deleted the per-subtree shims they resolved through; the bootstrap
# stays for the intra-subtree imports above.

    run, and process the queue by opening a new tab (page) per job in that
    same window. Each job dispatches to the per-ATS handler (Ashby /
    Greenhouse / Lever) or the prepare-only vision agent, captures the
    post-fill screenshot, marks the row `awaiting_human_submit`, and BLOCKS
    on terminal input() so the user can review what was typed, fix anything
    wrong, and click Submit themselves.

    Strictly serial — one form at a time. The human can only review one
    form at a time.

    Two behaviours added by the local-browser rewrite:

      - **Persistent, logged-in browser.** The browser is created once via
        ``open_browser_context`` — a persistent Chrome profile by default
        (``JOBIFY_BROWSER_PROFILE``) so ATS logins persist across runs, a

      - **Always-assisted-manual fallback.** EVERY non-success prepare exit

        result, a page that fails to load) degrades to
        :func:`assisted_manual_handoff` — tab left open, materials staged

    dispatches to the per-ATS DOM handler (Ashby / Greenhouse / Lever)

    Applied".

    ``jobify/submit/runner_legacy.py`` and has no console-script
    binding. PR-13 reused the ``jobify-submit`` script name on
    purpose.

    counts.
