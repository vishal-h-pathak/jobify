# jobify.tailor

Application-prep + DOM-based form-fill pipeline for the configured candidate.
Reads approved jobs from Supabase (written by the `jobify.hunt`
subpackage — PR-9 unified what was previously a sibling `job-hunter`
repo into this monorepo), tailors a resume + cover letter + form-answer
drafts, opens a visible browser, fills standard fields via per-ATS
Playwright handlers (Ashby / Greenhouse / Lever) or a prepare-only
vision agent, and **stops at the form's Submit button**.

The system never clicks Submit. The human reviews the visible browser,
clicks Submit themselves, and then clicks "Mark Applied" in the
dashboard cockpit. That click — not any system signal — is the source
of truth that the job was actually submitted.

User-layer ground truth lives in the unified `jobify` repo at
`profile/` (top-level) + `jobify/hunt/profile/`. `prompts.load_profile()`
scans both via `_resolve_profile_search_dirs()`. See `DATA_CONTRACT.md`.

## Pipeline (post M-1..M-7, career-ops alignment)

```
job-hunter writes → status=new
   ↓ (you mark approved in dashboard)
status=approved
   ↓ pipeline.py::process_approved_jobs
[archetype classify] → [resume tailor] → [cover letter]
   → [LaTeX compile + PDF upload] → [STAR+R stories]
   → [form_answers (M-1, gated on score >= 6)]
   → [resolve ATS URL]
status=ready_for_review  (PDFs + form_answers in Postgres; cockpit
                          renders everything for human review)
   ↓ (Pre-fill Form click in /dashboard/review/[job_id])
status=prefilling
   ↓ pipeline.py::process_prefill_requested_jobs (visible browser)
[per-ATS DOM handler — Ashby / Greenhouse / Lever — OR
 prepare-only vision agent for unknown ATSes]
   → [post-fill screenshot uploaded to job-materials Storage]
   → [terminal blocks on input() while browser stays open]
status=awaiting_human_submit
   ↓ (HUMAN reviews visible browser, clicks Submit themselves;
      then comes back and clicks "Mark Applied" in cockpit)
status=applied  (the cockpit click is the source of truth)
```

Every LLM call along the way uses the prompts in `prompts/` and reads
the canonical user-layer profile.

## Running manually

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
playwright install chromium

jobify-tailor --status                    # job counts by status
jobify-tailor --test-tailor <job_id>      # smoke-test tailoring + form_answers (read-only)
jobify-tailor                             # tailor approved jobs only (no browser).
                                           # Runs process_approved_jobs() and exits.

jobify-submit --status                    # same status output as --status above
jobify-submit                             # visible-browser pre-fill for any rows the
                                           # cockpit flagged. Terminal blocks on input()
                                           # so you can review and click Submit yourself.

# PR-13 split the previous combined cycle into the two scripts above.
# Run `jobify-tailor` whenever there are approved rows to materialize;
# run `jobify-submit` when you're at the keyboard and ready to file a
# pre-filled application.
```

Standalone scripts:

```bash
python -m scripts.analyze_patterns         # weekly pattern report (J-6)

## Tailor auth

Every tailor Claude call (resume, LaTeX resume, cover letter,
form-answers, archetype classifier) goes through `jobify.shared.llm`'s
`complete()`, which resolves auth **per call** in a fixed chain — ported
from the portfolio repo's `chat-auth.ts` / `chat-oauth.ts`:

1. **API credits (preferred).** `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` is set and not in
   cool-off → the Anthropic Messages API, with prompt caching preserved
   (the cached system blocks pass straight through).
2. **Subscription OAuth (fallback).** The API key is absent, *or* was
   just benched by a billing/credit/auth failure, **and**
   `CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN` is set → the Claude Agent SDK under
   Max-plan OAuth. Prompt caching does not apply on this path (it's the
   fallback). The OAuth subprocess inherits the environment but
   **drops `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`** so a billing-blocked key can't shadow
   the subscription token.
3. **Neither configured** → `RuntimeError`.

**Cool-off.** When the Messages API returns an *unusable-key* error —
`401` (invalid key) or a `400/402/403` whose message matches
`billing|credit|balance|purchase|payment|plan` (e.g. *"Your credit
balance is too low"*) — the key is benched **process-wide for 15
minutes** and that call falls through to OAuth. Transient errors
(`429`, `5xx`, network) are **not** benched: they re-raise so the
caller's per-job failure handling catches them. The cool-off resets on
process restart.

**Two secrets.**

- `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` — pay-as-you-go credits, the primary path.
- `CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN` — from `claude setup-token` on a machine
  logged into the Max plan; add it as a GitHub Actions secret to enable
  the fallback in `tailor.yml` / `tailor-manual.yml`. Those workflows
  `npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code` because the Agent SDK
  spawns the bundled Claude Code CLI as a subprocess.

> **Intended-use caveat.** Subscription OAuth via the Agent SDK is
> designed for interactive agentic coding. Running an unattended tailor
> batch (~5 calls/job) against Max-plan rolling usage caps is a gray
> area. The fallback is opt-in: leave `CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN` unset to
> keep the tailor API-only. A Max rate-limit/usage error on the OAuth
> path surfaces as a clean per-job failure (that job is marked failed,
> the batch continues) — it never crashes the whole run.

## What changed (career-ops integration, 2026-04-27)

- **J-2**: Scorer (in job-hunter) emits posting-legitimacy as a separate
  axis. Migration `003_legitimacy.sql` lives here for ergonomics.
- **J-3**: STAR+R story generator + `star_stories` table. Stories
  accumulate as a side effect of every tailoring run; `/dashboard/stories`
  curates the master set.
- **J-4**: Archetype classifier routes each JD into one of five lanes
  before tailoring. Persisted on the job row for `/dashboard/insights`.
- **J-5**: `tailor.normalize.normalize_for_ats()` runs on every cover-
  letter + LaTeX bullet before PDF compile.
- **J-6**: `analyze_patterns.py` writes to `pattern_analyses`; the
  insights page renders the latest run.
- **J-7**: Every inline prompt extracted to `prompts/*.md`. Loader
  prepends `_shared.md` once and supports template substitution.
- **J-9**: `cv_sync_check.py` runs as a side effect of `tailor_resume`
  import; warns on drift but never blocks.
- **J-11**: Match Agent → profile writeback writes to
  `profile/learned-insights.md` (top-level; recognized by the user-
  layer loader).

## What changed (career-ops alignment, 2026-04-28)

DOM-based form-fill, stop-at-submit, manual-submission cockpit. The
system never clicks Submit anymore.

- **M-1**: `tailor/form_answers.py` produces a structured JSON of
  identity + four narrative fields. Identity / contact / location /
  comp / work-auth / current-employment fields come from `profile.yml`
  in Python — the LLM only drafts `why_this_role`, `why_this_company`,
  optional `additional_info`, and JD-specific `additional_questions`.
  Persisted to `jobs.form_answers` JSONB. Gated on score >= 6.
- **M-2**: Status flow simplified to
  `discovered → approved → preparing → ready_for_review → prefilling →
  awaiting_human_submit → applied`. Migration 007 collapses legacy
  `ready_to_submit` / `submit_confirmed` / `submitting` rows into
  `ready_for_review` and adds the stop-at-submit columns
  (`submission_url`, `prefill_screenshot_path`, `prefill_completed_at`,
  `submitted_at`, `submission_notes`).
- **M-3**: New per-ATS DOM handlers for Greenhouse and Lever (modeled
  on `applicant/ashby.py`). All three are pure Playwright — zero
  Anthropic API calls — and read from `jobs.form_answers`. `ashby.py`
  refactored to read from `form_answers` instead of hardcoded values;
  its `submit()` / `_click_submit` / `_wait_for_confirmation` removed.
  `applicant/detector.py` flipped: per-ATS handlers default;
  `UniversalApplicant` is the fallback. `USE_LEGACY_APPLICANTS` env
  flag removed.
- **M-4**: `applicant/agent_loop.py` stripped of submit mode and the
  `click_submit` tool. The vision agent is prepare-only; can call
  `finish_preparation` or `queue_for_review` and nothing else terminal.
  `BrowserSession.mode` / `submitted` / `submit_confirmation_text`
  removed. `prompts/agent_submit.md` deleted. `form_answers` injected
  into the agent's system prompt so it doesn't OCR identity fields.
- **M-5**: `process_prefill_requested_jobs()` orchestrator opens a
  visible browser, dispatches uniformly to the per-ATS handler or the
  prepare-only vision agent (via `UniversalApplicant.apply_with_page`),
  uploads the post-fill screenshot to Storage, marks
  `awaiting_human_submit`, sends `notify_awaiting_submit`, then
  **blocks on terminal `input()`** while the human reviews.
- **M-6**: Dashboard cockpit at `/dashboard/review/[job_id]` (in the
  sibling `portfolio` repo). Header / status banner / three-accordion
  materials section / pre-fill screenshot / Match Agent panel / sticky
  action bar (Pre-fill Form, Mark Applied modal, Open Manually, Skip,
  Mark Failed). New API routes: `prefill`, `mark-applied`, `skip`,
  `mark-failed`. The "Mark Applied" click is the single source of
  truth for whether a job got submitted.
- **M-7**: `run_cycle` calls `process_approved_jobs +
  process_prefill_requested_jobs`. Removed `process_confirmed_jobs`,
  `submit_one_visible`, and `--submit-visible` (~170 lines).
- **M-8**: `notify_ready_for_review` body now includes score, tier,
  archetype, legitimacy, and a deep link to the cockpit. New
  `notify_awaiting_submit(job, screenshot_path)` for the awaiting-
  human-submit state. Set `PORTFOLIO_BASE_URL` to override the
  cockpit base URL for staging deploys.

### Cost profile

- **Ashby / Greenhouse / Lever** — `$0` in form-fill tokens. DOM
  handlers read everything from `jobs.form_answers` (which itself was
  written by a single Sonnet call during tailoring).
- **Vision-agent fallback** (Workday / iCIMS / SmartRecruiters /
  aggregators) — roughly `~$3/job` of agent-loop tokens, similar to
  the previous flow but cheaper because identity fields no longer
  require OCR — they come pre-baked in the system prompt.
- **`form_answers` generation itself** — one Sonnet call per
  ready-for-review job, ~2k output tokens. Gated on score >= 6 so
  jobs that won't be applied don't burn the call.

## Companion subpackages and repos

- `jobify.hunt` — discovery + scoring (writes status=new rows). PR-9
  unified what was previously the sibling `job-hunter` repo into this
  subpackage; the original repo can be archived after PR-9 merges.
- `../portfolio` — Next.js dashboard (your dashboard).
  Stays as a separate repo (frontend, deployed on Vercel).
