"""jobify.shared.ats_detect — Detect which ATS platform a job URL uses (M-3).

Routing layer used by tailor's prepare flow and (eventually) submit's
deterministic flow. Each known ATS gets its own per-platform DOM-based
handler (Ashby, Greenhouse, Lever) that reads from ``job["form_answers"]``
and never makes Anthropic API calls. Anything we don't have a handler
for falls through to ``UniversalApplicant``, which drives the page via a
prepare-only Claude tool-use agent (M-4 strips its submit-mode tool).

The ``USE_LEGACY_APPLICANTS`` env flag is gone — per-ATS handlers are the
default and the cheap path. The vision agent is the fallback for the
messier middle of the funnel (Workday, iCIMS, SmartRecruiters,
aggregator-direct postings).

Moved from ``jobify/tailor/applicant/detector.py`` in PR-4 because the
routing decision is shared infrastructure, not tailor-specific. The
``applicant/detector.py`` path remains as a re-export shim until PR-9.

    needed to make those modules importable.
