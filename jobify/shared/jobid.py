jobify.shared.jobid — canonical job IDs for cross-source dedup.

Different sources surface the same role via different URLs (Greenhouse direct
post vs SerpAPI's reshare vs an Indeed scrape). To keep one Supabase row per
real job, we hash on the (canonical_url, normalized_company, normalized_title)
tuple instead of including the source name. The legacy per-source hash lived
inside each source module and double-counted.

If a stable ATS URL is available we strip query strings and hash that;
otherwise we fall back to (company, title) so cross-source matches still
collapse when the URL differs but the role is identifiable.

Moved here from jobify/hunt/utils/jobid.py in PR-1; the legacy path is now a
re-export shim and gets removed in PR-3 when hunter sources migrate.
