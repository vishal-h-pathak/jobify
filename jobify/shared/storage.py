jobify.shared.storage — Supabase Storage download helpers shared by hunt /
tailor / submit.

Hosts the unified ``download_to_tmp`` and ``download_bytes`` (formerly
duplicated across job-applicant/storage.py and job-submitter/storage.py with
divergent bodies). The unified body adopts:

  - the applicant version's defensive empty-download check + try/except
    cleanup (resume PDFs are user-visible; silent empty downloads would
    corrupt a submission)
  - the submitter version's optional ``suffix`` parameter and debug log

Other storage operations (uploads, deletes, signed-URL generation, screenshot
upload) remain in their original modules until later PRs.

The Supabase client is created lazily inside ``_get_client`` so importing this
module does not require ``supabase`` to be installed — only calling a function
does. This keeps ``pytest --collect-only`` working in environments where the
runtime SDK isn't installed.
