"""jobify.shared.liveness — positive dead-posting detection.

Single source of truth for "is this job posting dead?", shared by:

  - the weekly ``jobify/hunt/scripts/check_liveness.py`` cron (rechecks
    stale rows), and
  - the hunt-time discovery gate in ``jobify.hunt.agent._execute`` (drops
    closed postings before they reach the scorer / digest).

Keeping the closed-phrase list and the classification logic here means the
cron and the live hunt can't drift.

Conservative by design — only a POSITIVE signal returns ``"dead"``:
HTTP 404/410, a dead-URL redirect substring, or a closed-phrase match in
the page body. Network errors, timeouts, ``None`` status, and non-404 5xx
responses return ``"unknown"`` so a flaky fetch never buries a live role.
