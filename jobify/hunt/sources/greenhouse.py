"""sources/greenhouse.py — Greenhouse boards-api source (J-1).

Direct Greenhouse public-API scanner:
    https://boards-api.greenhouse.io/v1/boards/{slug}/jobs?content=true

Pure HTTP/JSON. No LLM tokens spent on discovery. Each posting is
title-pre-filtered against `profile/portals.yml::title_filter` before
the LLM scorer ever sees it.

Company list lives in `profile/portals.yml::greenhouse.companies`. The
in-module `_FALLBACK_COMPANIES` is consulted only if portals.yml is
missing — keeps the hunter running during cutover.

Mode handling: in `local_remote` mode roles whose location is neither
Atlanta/GA nor remote-shaped are skipped. `us_wide` keeps everything.
