"""sources/_http.py — polite-scraping helpers shared across hunt sources.

Three patterns used to live copy-pasted across ashby/greenhouse/lever and
(less rigorously) the other source modules:

  1. ``requests.get(url, timeout=N)`` wrapped in a try/except that logs and
     returns on failure, plus a 404-as-warning short-circuit so removed ATS
     boards don't blow up the run.
  2. A ``time.sleep`` between requests so we look like a polite client.
  3. Single import surface for ``passes_title_filter`` (from ``_portals``)
     and ``location_filter_enabled`` (from ``config``) — convenience so a
     source module doesn't import from three different modules just to do
     its filtering.

Each per-source ``_fetch_one`` shrinks to its real per-API logic
(URL template, auth header, pagination) once these helpers absorb the
boilerplate. The adapter family stays — we deliberately do not collapse
the per-source ``_fetch_one`` functions into one.
