"""sources/ashby.py — AshbyHQ public posting API (J-1).

Direct Ashby public-API scanner:
    https://api.ashbyhq.com/posting-api/job-board/{slug}?includeCompensation=true

Pure HTTP/JSON. No LLM tokens spent on discovery. Each posting is
title-pre-filtered against `profile/portals.yml::title_filter` before
the LLM scorer ever sees it.

Company list lives in `profile/portals.yml::ashby.companies`. The
in-module `_FALLBACK_COMPANIES` is consulted only if portals.yml is
missing.
