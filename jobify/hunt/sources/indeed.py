sources/indeed.py — Indeed RSS feed fetcher.

KEEP-DISABLED (PR-3): this module is intentionally NOT included in the
``SOURCES`` tuple in ``hunt/agent.py``. Indeed RSS has been fully gated
for unauthenticated callers since early 2026 and JSearch covers the same
publisher footprint behind one paid subscription. We keep the module on
disk for reference (the URL templates and per-(query, location) feed
shape remain useful documentation) but it is not exercised at runtime.
Re-enabling means flipping it back into the ``SOURCES`` tuple, not
ripping the file out.

Notes on reliability (April 2026): Indeed has been progressively gating its
public RSS feeds and routinely returns empty <channel>s for unauthenticated
callers. We do three things to defend against silent breakage:

1. Send a real User-Agent — feedparser's default UA is blocked outright on
   some Indeed paths.
2. Log per-(query, location) entry counts so an empty feed shows up in
   ``agent.log`` instead of vanishing.
3. Tolerate ``feed.bozo`` / parser exceptions and keep iterating other
   queries; we'd rather lose one query than the whole source.

If Indeed RSS goes fully dark, the right move is to swap to the SerpAPI
``site:indeed.com`` queries already implemented in ``linkedin.py`` style.
