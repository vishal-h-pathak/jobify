"""sources/hn_whoshiring.py — HackerNews "Ask HN: Who is hiring?" via Algolia.

Every month dang posts an "Ask HN: Who is hiring? (Month YYYY)" thread on
HN. Each top-level comment is a hiring company. The format is loose but
enough is conventional that we can extract usable rows:

    LINE 1:  "Company | Role | Location | Comp | Remote/Hybrid"
    BODY:    free text describing the role + an apply URL or email

This module:
  1. Asks the public Algolia HN search API for the most recent matching
     thread (no API key required).
  2. Pulls the full thread (including all top-level comments) via the HN
     Algolia items endpoint.
  3. Filters comments by keywords (same set as the other sources).
  4. Extracts a company name from the first line and the first http(s) URL
     from the body. Rows where neither can be parsed are skipped.

Reliability note: HN's signal-to-noise is high for AI/ML startups but the
parsing is best-effort. Expect ~70-80% of yielded rows to look clean.
