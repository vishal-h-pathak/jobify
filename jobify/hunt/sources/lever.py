"""sources/lever.py — Lever postings-API source (J-1).

Direct Lever public-API scanner:
    https://api.lever.co/v0/postings/{slug}?mode=json

Split out of `greenhouse.py` in J-1 so each ATS gets its own module and
the company list lives in `profile/portals.yml`. Pure HTTP/JSON, no LLM
spend on discovery. Each posting is title-pre-filtered before scoring.
