"""LinkedIn source — uses SerpAPI Google Jobs with site:linkedin.com filtering.

KEEP-DISABLED (PR-3): this module is intentionally NOT included in the
``SOURCES`` tuple in ``hunt/agent.py``. Two clean runs returned 0
results, and the JSearch source already covers LinkedIn-via-RapidAPI
behind the same paid subscription that pays for Indeed coverage. We
keep the file on disk because the SerpAPI ``site:linkedin.com/jobs``
query shape and the per-(query, location) budget pattern remain useful
documentation; re-enabling means flipping it back into the ``SOURCES``
tuple, not ripping the file out.

This piggybacks on the same SERPAPI_KEY as the main serpapi source but runs
a smaller set of high-signal queries specifically filtered to LinkedIn
postings, which tend to have richer descriptions and more accurate metadata.

Shares the per-run search budget with ``serpapi.py`` via the
``SERPAPI_MAX_SEARCHES`` env var; this module reads its own
``LINKEDIN_MAX_SEARCHES`` so the two sources don't fight over the same cap.
