"""
sources/serpapi.py — Google Jobs results via SerpAPI.

Cost discipline matters here: SerpAPI's free tier is 100 searches/month, and
the previous configuration burned ~72 searches per run (12 queries × 2 locs ×
3 pages). Three guards now enforce a per-run budget:

1. ``MAX_SEARCHES_PER_RUN`` hard cap. We stop iterating once we hit it and
   log a clear "budget exhausted" message rather than silently truncating.
2. Pagination short-circuits once a page yields nothing new (almost every
   page after the first is duplicates anyway).
3. Per-run logging of total searches issued so the budget shows up in
   ``agent.log``.

The query list and locations are mode-aware via ``config.get_mode()``.
