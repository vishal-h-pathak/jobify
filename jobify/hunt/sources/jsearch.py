"""sources/jsearch.py — JSearch (RapidAPI) Google Jobs aggregator.

JSearch wraps Google Jobs the same way SerpAPI does, but with a few useful
differences for our use case:

1. Each request returns up to 20 jobs across LinkedIn, Indeed, Glassdoor,
   ZipRecruiter, BeBee, Talent.com, and other publishers. One subscription
   replaces both the broken Indeed RSS source and the broken LinkedIn-via-
   SerpAPI source.
2. The free tier (200 requests/month) is enough for a daily run with a
   tight budget. Basic ($10/mo) gives 1,500/month — comfortable margin.
3. Pricing is per-request, not per-page, so one ``num_pages=2`` call costs
   the same as ``num_pages=1`` but returns twice the jobs.

Setup:
  1. Subscribe to JSearch on RapidAPI:
       https://rapidapi.com/letscrape-6bRBa3QguO5/api/jsearch
  2. Copy your "X-RapidAPI-Key" from the dashboard.
  3. Set ``JSEARCH_API_KEY=...`` in ``.env``.
  4. Optional: ``JSEARCH_MAX_REQUESTS_PER_RUN`` (default 8) caps spend per
     run. Each request returns up to 20 jobs across multiple publishers.

If ``JSEARCH_API_KEY`` is unset, the source no-ops with a single warning so
the rest of the run is unaffected — you can ship this code before signing
up.
