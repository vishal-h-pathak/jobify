hunt/agent.py — orchestration loop for the hunter.

Renamed from ``job_agent.py`` in PR-3 so the module path matches its
package role: ``jobify.hunt.agent``. The console script
``jobify-hunt`` (declared in pyproject.toml) calls ``run()`` directly.

Pipeline:
    1. Iterate every source. Each source already deduplicates within itself
       and now hashes job IDs source-agnostically (utils/jobid → shim for
       jobify.shared.jobid), so the same posting on Greenhouse + SerpAPI
       collapses to one row.
    2. Skip jobs already in Supabase (``get_seen_ids``).
    3. HEAD-validate the URL; drop dead links before spending Claude credits.
    4. Enrich descriptions that look like a marketing blurb.
    5. Score against the user-layer profile via Claude.
    6. Upsert into Supabase. ``send_digest`` keeps the legacy email path alive.

Two operating modes (see ``config.py``):
    - ``local_remote`` (default): only Atlanta, GA + remote roles.
    - ``us_wide``: also pulls non-remote US roles. Useful for wide sweeps.

Examples:
    jobify-hunt                          # local_remote (default)
    jobify-hunt --mode us_wide
    HUNTER_MODE=us_wide jobify-hunt

# ── sys.path bootstrap ────────────────────────────────────────────────────
# The hunt subtree's intra-subtree modules use unprefixed imports
# (``from sources import X``, ``from sources._http import …``,
# ``from scorer import score_job``, ``from enricher import …``). When
# this module is imported as ``jobify.hunt.agent`` (e.g. via the
# ``jobify-hunt`` console script), sys.path won't contain
# ``jobify/hunt/`` and those bare imports would fail. Insert the
# directory before any other imports run so every downstream module load
# resolves cleanly. PR-9 rewrote the cross-cutting bare imports
# (``import config``, ``from db import …``, ``from notifier import …``,
# ``from utils.jobid import …``) to canonical ``jobify.*`` paths and
# deleted the per-subtree shims they resolved through; the bootstrap
# stays for the intra-subtree imports above.
