"""Description enricher — fetches full job posting text when sources provide sparse summaries.

Many sources (Indeed RSS, some SerpAPI results) return short marketing
blurbs instead of the actual job description. This module follows the
job URL and attempts to extract the real posting text, giving the scorer
much better signal.

Flattened from ``utils/enricher.py`` in PR-3. The local ``_strip_html`` /
``WHITESPACE_RE`` pair was promoted to ``jobify.shared.html`` as
``clean_html_to_text``.

Usage:
    enriched = enrich_description(job)
    # Returns the original job dict with description replaced if a
    # richer version was found, or unchanged if not.
