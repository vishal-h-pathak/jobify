"""scripts/check_profile_sync.py — flag drift between profile.yml and CLAUDE.md.

``profile/profile.yml`` is the user-layer ground truth; the repo-root
``CLAUDE.md`` carries a hand-mirrored prose form of the same facts for
LLM prompt context. The mirror is maintained by hand, so facts drift
(Session C's motivating example: the book-club URL read ``papercuts.org``
in the narrative long after the real site moved to ``papercuts.cc``).

This script diffs the small set of facts most likely to drift — URLs,
the comp band, and the base location — and exits non-zero when the
narrative disagrees with the YAML. CI runs it as a soft warning step
(``continue-on-error``), so drift annotates the build without failing it.

Checks:
  1. Location — ``identity.location_base`` must appear verbatim in CLAUDE.md.
  2. Comp band — every dollar figure in ``location_and_compensation``
     (current + target endpoints) must appear in CLAUDE.md in its
     thousands form (e.g. 110000 → "110k", allowing "$110k"/"~$110k").
  3. URLs — for every domain written in profile.yml, if CLAUDE.md
     mentions the same site (same first label, e.g. "papercuts"), the
     full domain must match exactly. This catches TLD drift
     (papercuts.org vs papercuts.cc) without requiring every YAML URL
     to appear in the narrative.

Usage:
    python scripts/check_profile_sync.py
