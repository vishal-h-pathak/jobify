"""PR-1 regression test for jobify.shared.jobid.make_job_id.

Pins golden hashes so any future change to make_job_id (or its helpers
canonical_url / _normalise_text) trips the test before reaching production.
make_job_id is a god-node in cross-source dedup (15 callers per the graphify
report); silent drift would re-double-count jobs and inflate the queue.
