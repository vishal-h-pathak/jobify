"""tests/test_assisted_manual_handoff.py — always-assisted-manual fallback (Part 2).

``jobify.submit.handoff.assisted_manual_handoff`` is the worst-case output of
the prepare flow: tab left open on the application page, tailored materials
downloaded locally ready to drag in, and a checklist of what couldn't be
filled — never a bare failure.

These tests target the helper directly with a fake page + monkeypatched
storage/db, asserting:

  - materials are downloaded to ``<handoff>/<company>_<job_id>/`` as
    ``resume.pdf`` + ``cover_letter.pdf`` + ``cover_letter.txt``;
  - a checklist (unfilled fields + role-specific questions) is built and
    written to the jobs row's ``application_notes``;
  - the row is marked ``awaiting_human_submit`` (assisted-manual hand-off,
    not a hard failure);
  - the page is NOT closed.

Offline — no Supabase, no real Playwright, no network.
